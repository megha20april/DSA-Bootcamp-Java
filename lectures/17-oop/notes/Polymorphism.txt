Polymorphism in Java

Polymorphism in Java is a concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways. 
Polymorphism is derived from 2 Greek words: poly and morphs. 
The word "poly" means many and "morphs" means forms. So polymorphism means many forms.

There are two types of polymorphism in Java: 
-- compile-time polymorphism => achieved by method overloading
-- runtime polymorphism => achieved by method overriding.
