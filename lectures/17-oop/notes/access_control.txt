Access Control:

How a member can be accessed is determined by the access modifier attached to its declaration.
Usually, you will want to restrict access to the data members of a class—allowing access only through methods.
Also, there will be times when you will want to define methods that are private to a class.

Java’s access modifiers are public, private, and protected. Java also defines a default access level.
protected applies only when inheritance is involved.

When no access modifier is used, then by default the member of a class is public within its own package,
but cannot be accessed outside of its package.

            │ Class │ Package │ Subclass │ Subclass │ World
            │       │         │(same pkg)│(diff pkg)│(diff pkg & not subclass)            + : accessible
────────────┼───────┼─────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────────────────────           blank : not accessible        
public      │   +   │    +    │    +     │     +    │   +
────────────┼───────┼─────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────────────────────
protected   │   +   │    +    │    +     │     +    │
────────────┼───────┼─────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────────────────────

────────────┼───────┼─────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────────────────────

public - you can use it anywhere, for outside packages, just import the package of oour class and that's it, you can use it.
protected - it can be used anywhere within the same package, BUT for outside packages, it can be only used through an inherited subclass.
no modifier - you can't use this outside the package.
private - only accessible in that class.


package packageOne;
public class Base
{
    protected void display(){
        System.out.println("in Base");
    }
}

package packageTwo;
public class Derived extends packageOne.Base{
    public void show(){
        new Base().display();       // this is not working
        new Derived().display();    // is working
        display();//is working
    }
}

protected allows access from subclasses and from other classes in the same package.
We can use child class to use protected member outside the package but only child class object can access it.
That's why any Derived class instance can access the protected method in Base.
The other line creates a Base instance (not a Derived instance!!).
And access to protected methods of that instance is only allowed from objects of the same package.

display();
-> allowed, because the caller, an instance of Derived has access to protected members and fields of its subclasses,
even if they're in different packages


new Derived().display();
-> allowed, because you call the method on an instance of Derived and that instance has access to the protected methods
of its subclasses

new Base().display();
-> not allowed because the caller's (the this instance) class is not defined in the same package like the Base class,
so this can't access the protected method. 

this is because if it were allowed, then there would be no difference in protected and public. HOW?
            when we inherit a class outside the same package, we can make instances of the super-class right?
            AND when we don't inherit a class but import our class package into the outside package,
                        then also we can make instances of the super-class right?

            BUTTT since the instance created, is an instance of super-class, it doesn't know if it's being used through inheritance
            or through simple import
            hence to differentiate between these two situations 
            the protected fields of the sub-class can be accessed ONLY through a sub-class instance.
            this is to make sure ki YES it is being used through inheritance and not just be importing the package


Remember that any time talks about a subclass having an access to a superclass member, we could be talking about the
subclass inheriting the member, not simple accessing the member through a reference to an instance of the superclass.


class C
    protected member;

// in a different package

class S extends C

    obj.member; // only allowed if type of obj is S or subclass of S

The motivation is probably as following. If obj is an S, class S has sufficient knowledge of its internals,
it has the right to manipulate its members, and it can do this safely.
If obj is not an S, it's probably another subclass S2 of C, which S has no idea of.
S2 may have not even been born when S is written. For S to manipulate S2's protected internals is quite dangerous.
If this is allowed, from S2's point of view, it doesn't know who will tamper with its protected internals and how,
this makes S2 job very hard to reason about its own state.

Now if obj is D, and D extends S, is it dangerous for S to access obj.member? Not really.
How S uses member is a shared knowledge of S and all its subclasses, including D. S as the superclass has the right to
define behaviours, and D as the subclass has the obligation to accept and conform.

For easier understanding, the rule should really be simplified to require obj's (static) type to be exactly S.
After all, it's very unusual and inappropriate for subclass D to appear in S. And even if it happens,
that the static type of obj is D, our simplified rule can deal with it easily by upcasting: ((S)obj).member
