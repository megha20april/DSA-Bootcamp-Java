Basically what encapsulation is,
is data hiding
like i want to protect my data from outside world or like i don't want any outside interference to my code
then i'll do encapsulation through access modifiers
and only provide access to them through getters and setters

this is basically like for example,
in a linked list class i don't want anybody outside this class
to be able to access the head, hence i'll just hide it (private)
